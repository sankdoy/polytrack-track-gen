Random track generator that outputs PolyTrack `v3` share codes.

## How to use

1. Open the website.
2. Adjust the settings (length, elevation, curviness, checkpoints, environment, etc).
3. Click **Generate**.
4. Copy the generated `v3` share code from the results.
5. In PolyTrack, import the share code to load the track.

Tips:
- Set a **Seed** to make results repeatable.
- Increase **Batch Count** to roll multiple tracks quickly.
- If a track looks broken, roll again or increase generation limits (like **Max Attempts / Piece**).
