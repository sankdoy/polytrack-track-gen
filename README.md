# PolyTrack Track Generator

random track generator that outputs PolyTrack `v3` share codes.

## Run locally (Node)

```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.



Notes:
- The Pages build uses `pako` from a CDN for compression when encoding share codes.
- The Node GUI (`npm start`) is separate and not used by GitHub Pages.
